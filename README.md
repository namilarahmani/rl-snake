# rl-final-project

Todo:
note: looks like tabular RL is not going to work in this context

- [] Get existing implementation of snake game working
[] Implement baseline algorithm (randomly choosing from feasible actions)
[] Implement tile coding for grid representation
[] Implement linear Q-learning and collect results
[] Implement deep Q-learning and collect results
[] Implement PPO and collect results
[] Repeat all of the above experiments with variation of extra apples on screen
[] Maybe implement as POMDP
